# baseball_pitch_prediction
# More formal: Baseball Pitch Prediction with Deep Learning.
Predicting MLB pitch outcomes using sequential deep learning models and Statcast data. 

[![Python 3.11](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Project Overview 
This project aims to explore the application of neural networks, along with more modern modeling frameworks like Transformers to study pitch sequences and predict pitch outcomes in Major League Baseball. I'm interested in not only predicting pitch outcomes, but the sequences themselves, and why they are composed in that way, so to speak.

## Current Status
🚧 **Work in Progress** - Currently setting up project infrastructure. 

## Planned Models 
- [ ]: Baseline: Feedforward Neural Network 
- [ ]: LSTM: Sequential prediction model (Long Short-Term Memory)
- [ ]: Transformer: Attention-based architecture

## Installation 

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Mamba/Conda (recommended) or pip 
- Git 

### Setup 
```bash 
# Clone repository 
git clone https://github.com/ad-bernardi/baseball_pitch_prediction
cd baseball_pitch_prediction

# create environment with Mamba (recommended!)
mamba env create -f environment.yml 

# activate said environment 
mamba activate baseball_ml 

# installing project in editable mode 
pip install -e 
```
## Quick start 
```bash 
# downloading data 
python scripts/download_data.py --start-year 2024 --end-year 2024 

# or you can use a makefile 
make data 
```

A project for predicting Baseball pitches and seeing what we can find out about pitch sequencing. Ideally we will start with Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, and then we will move in to more modern approaches like Transformers.
